# my computer is a home that my friends can visit :n)

A website is just a collection of files in a folder.

Hosting a website is like inviting your friends over to a folder on your computer.

This is a folder party that I'll be hosting for a short while.

Created with my tiny [folder party generator](https://github.com/lizzthabet/make-your-computer-a-home).
